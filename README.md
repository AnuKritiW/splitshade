# SplitShade - a browser-based WebGPU Playground

This project is a work in progress. For now, I am storing some notes on my README as I go along.

## Developer Notes

This version of the playground enforces a ShaderToy-style execution model:
- Only fragment shaders are accepted from user input.
- A hardcoded fullscreen vertex shader is injected automatically at runtime.
- Fragment shaders are compiled and run over the entire canvas using a triangle covering the full screen.
- Vertex and compute entry points are still detected (via `wgsl_reflect`), but are ignored and warned about in the console.

This setup ensures that users can write fragment shaders without having to define vertex logic or pipeline configuration.

### Injected Uniforms

The following uniforms are automatically injected and available to fragment shaders:

- `iResolution: vec3<f32>`  
  - Canvas resolution in pixels: (width, height, 1.0)

- `iTime: f32`  
  - Seconds since the render loop began

- `iMouse: vec4<f32>`  
  - Mouse position in pixels (`x`, `y`), click state (`z` = 1.0 when down, 0.0 otherwise), and padding (`w` = 0.0)

- `iChannel0`

- `iChannel0Sampler`

### Texture + Sampler Support

This phase adds support for rendering with an external image using `textureSample()` in fragment shaders. The image is loaded at runtime and passed to the shader via a bind group containing both a **texture view** and a **sampler**.

- The image is placed in `public/textures/` and served via the Vite base URL (`/splitshade/`).
- A `GPUTexture` is created from the decoded image bitmap.
- A `GPUTextureView` and `GPUSampler` are then created and added to the shaderâ€™s bind group at bindings `@binding(3)` and `@binding(4)`, respectively.

### Shader Examples

- `whiteCircle-resolutionTest.wgsl`: Uses `iResolution`
- `pulsingColours-timeTest.wgsl`: Uses `iTime`
- `mousePointerTest.wgsl`: Uses `iMouse`
- `defaultTex.wgsl`: Uses `iChannel0` abd `iChannel0Sampler`
